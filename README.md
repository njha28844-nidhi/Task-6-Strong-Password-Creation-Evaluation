# Task 6 – Password Security and Strength Analysis

## 1. Objective  
The objective of this task is to understand how password complexity affects its strength and security. In this task, I created multiple passwords with different levels of complexity and evaluated them using an online password strength checker.  

This task helped me understand:
- How weak passwords are easily guessable.
- How strong passwords resist brute force and dictionary attacks.
- Why password complexity is important in real-world security.

## 2. Tool Used  
For evaluating password strength, I used the following online tool:

🔗 https://www.passwordmeter.com

This tool analyzes passwords based on:
- Length
- Uppercase letters
- Lowercase letters
- Numbers
- Special characters
- Repetition and patterns

## 3. Passwords Created

I created 5 passwords with increasing complexity levels:

| Password | Type |
|---------|------|
| ansh123 | Very Weak |
| Ansh@123 | Weak |
| Ansh@Cyber | Medium |
| Ansh@Cyber2025 | Strong |
| A#n$h_CyB3r!2025 | Very Strong |

---

## 4. Password Testing Process

Each password was tested on passwordmeter.com and analyzed based on:
- Password Length  
- Character Variety  
- Number of Symbols  
- Uppercase and Lowercase Mix  
- Predictability  

I took screenshots of each result page and added them in the screenshots folder as proof of analysis.

## 5. Password Strength Evaluation Results

| Password | Score | Strength |
|---------|------|---------|
| ansh123 | ~12% | Very Weak |
| Ansh@123 | ~38% | Weak |
| Ansh@Cyber | ~57% | Medium |
| Ansh@Cyber2025 | ~78% | Strong |
| A#n$h_CyB3r!2025 | ~95% | Very Strong |

## 6. Reason for Strength Differences

### Weak Passwords:
- Short length
- Only letters + numbers
- Easy to guess
- Can be cracked using dictionary attacks

### Strong Passwords:
- Longer length
- Mix of uppercase, lowercase, numbers and symbols
- Difficult to guess
- Resistant to brute force and dictionary attacks

## 7. Types of Password Attacks

### 1. Brute Force Attack  
In this type of attack, an attacker tries all possible combinations until the correct password is found.

Weak passwords like:
ansh123
Password2024

Example of a strong password:
A#n$h_CyB3r!2025
